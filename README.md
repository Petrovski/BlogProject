# Laravel Blog

Welcome to the GitHub Repository for my blog application made using **Laravel**. It is a fully functional blog with a user login/registation authentication system and image uploading for blog posts. To create a post, **you must** create an account and login. Use a fake email address and password to fully test the app!

You can view the application [**here**](https://glacial-basin-96295.herokuapp.com/)
